/*
 * This implements the TCG's TPM SPI Hardware Protocol on the SPI bus, using
 * the Cr50 SPS (SPI slave) controller. This turns out to be very similar to
 * the EC host command protocol, which is itself similar to HDLC. All of those
 * protocols provide ways to identify data frames over transports that don't
 * provide them natively. That's the nice thing about standards: there are so
 * many to choose from.
 *
 * ANYWAY, The goal of the TPM protocol is to provide read and write access to
 * device registers over the SPI bus. It is defined as follows (note that the
 * master clocks the bus, but both master and slave transmit data
 * simultaneously).
 *
 * Each transaction starts with the master clocking the bus to transfer 4
 * bytes:
 *
 * The master sends 4 bytes:       [R/W+size-1] [Addr] [Addr] [Addr]
 * The slave also sends 4 bytes:       [xx]      [xx]   [xx]   [x?]
 *
 * Bytes sent by the master define the direction and size (1-64 bytes) of the
 * data transfer, and the address of the register to access.
 *
 * The final bit of the 4th slave response byte determines whether or not the
 * slave needs some extra time. If that bit is 1, the master can IMMEDIATELY
 * clock in (or out) the number of bytes it specified with the header byte 0.
 *
 * If the final bit of the 4th response byte is 0, the master clocks eight more
 * bits and looks again at the new received byte. It repeats this process
 * (clock 8 bits, look at last bit) as long as every eighth bit is 0.
 *
 * When the slave is ready to proceed with the data transfer, it returns a 1
 * for the final bit of the response byte, at which point the master has to
 * resume transferring valid data for write transactions or to start reading
 * bytes sent by the slave for read transactions.
 *
 * So here's what a 4-byte write of value of 0x11223344 to register 0xAABBCC
 * might look like:
 *
 *   xfer:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
 *   MOSI: 03 aa bb cc xx xx xx 11 22 33 44
 *   MISO: xx xx xx x0 x0 x0 x1 xx xx xx xx
 *
 * Bit 0 of MISO xfer #4 is 0, indicating that the slave needs to stall. The
 * slave stalled for three bytes before it was ready to continue accepting the
 * input data from the master. The slave released the stall in xfer #7.
 *
 * Here's a 4-byte read from register 0xAABBCC:
 *
 *   xfer:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
 *   MOSI: 83 aa bb cc xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
 *   MISO: xx xx xx x0 x0 x0 x1 11 22 33 44
 *
 * As before, the slave stalled the read for three bytes and indicated it was
 * done stalling at xfer #7.
 *
 * Note that the ONLY place where a stall can be initiated is the last bit of
 * the fourth MISO byte of the transaction. Once the stall is released,
 * there's no stopping the rest of the data transfer.
